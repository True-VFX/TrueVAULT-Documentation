# TrueVAULT Blender Add-on

TrueVAULT integrates an asset store into Blender so you can browse, buy, and import assets without leaving the 3D View.

## What You Can Do
- Browse public and owned assets.
- Filter by categories, tags, type, price, ownership.
- View rich product details and image galleries.
- Purchase with credits and redeem recharge codes.
- Import assets (Objects, Textures, Heightmaps) directly into the scene.
- Manage versions, qualities, and updates for owned assets.
- See download history and license info.
- Handle account profile, MFA, and sign-in flows.

## Quick Start (Summary)
1. Install the add-on (Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...).
2. Open the Sidebar (N) in the 3D View. Select the TrueVAULT panel.
3. Sign In or create an account if needed.
4. Use the search bar or open Filters (funnel icon) or Categories (triangle icon) to narrow results.
5. Click a product title to open details. Use Purchase if you have enough credits.
6. After purchase, click Import to place or apply the asset.
7. Use the gear icon on owned assets to choose Version & Quality.
