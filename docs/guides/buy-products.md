## Prerequisites

!!! info "Before you start"
    - [ ] You are signed in (avatar visible in the add-on header)
    - [ ] You have enough credits OR access to Recharge / Redeem Code
    - [ ] You have a stable internet connection
    - [ ] The asset is not already owned (no Import button yet)

## Purchase Paths
Choose whichever is faster for your workflow.

=== "From Product Card"

    1. Browse / search until you see a card without an Import button.
    2. Click **Purchase** (if the button is directly present) *or* click the card title to open details.
    3. Review the confirmation dialog.
    4. Click **Confirm Purchase** if balance sufficient.

=== "From Detail Page"

    1. Open the product detail page by clicking its title.
    2. Review description, variants, and price breakdown.
    3. Press **Purchase**.
    4. Confirm in the dialog.

??? tip "Dialog Reference"
    **Fields shown**: icon/thumbnail, product name, price (credits), your balance (shows an *Insufficient* label if too low), and action buttons.  
    If low on credits: **Recharge Credits** (opens browser) or **Redeem Code** (opens in-add-on flow).  
    Prices may vary by region or promotional events.

## Step-by-Step Checklist
Mark items as you progress.

- [ ] Locate a product you do not own.
- [ ] Open its detail or use card shortcut.
- [ ] Press **Purchase**.
- [ ] Confirm after verifying price & balance.
- [ ] (If insufficient) Recharge or Redeem Code, then retry.
- [ ] Wait for success message.
- [ ] Verify button changed to **Import**.

## Handling Insufficient Credits

!!! warning "Balance not enough"
    Your balance line is highlighted and an **Insufficient** tag appears. Use one of:  
    - **Recharge Credits**: opens your browser to the credit purchase portal.  
    - **Redeem Code**: enter a voucher to instantly increase balance.  
    After adding credits, re-open the dialog if it auto-closed.

???+ note "Why a dialog?"
    The dialog ensures the final price and your balance are locked at the moment of confirmation, reducing race conditions if prices or promotions update.

## After Purchase

!!! success "Purchase complete"
    - Credits decreased by the price paid.
    - Card updates: **Import** + **Settings** buttons appear.  
    - Ownership badge or tag displays (if configured).  
    - Variants & updates now accessible (see [Manage Variants & Updates](manage-variants-updates.md)).

### Quick Verification
1. Find the product card again.  
2. Confirm the **Import** button is visible.  
3. Check your updated credit balance in the header or balance panel.  
4. Optionally open **View Download History** to confirm the entry was logged.

## Troubleshooting

??? failure "Purchase fails or seems stuck"
    - Ensure you are still signed in (session may have expired).  
    - Check connectivity; offline mode cannot finalize purchases.  
    - Retry once; transient network issues can occur.  
    - If credits deducted but no ownership: capture the log and open [Refund a Purchase](refund-purchase.md).

??? question "Balance didn't update"
    - Click refresh / sync in the add-on.  
    - Wait a few seconds; the balance service may be slightly delayed.  
    - If still stale, sign out and back in to force a cache clear.
