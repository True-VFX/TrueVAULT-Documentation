# Use Bundles

Bundles group multiple assets under one purchase.

## Identify Bundles
- Product Type filter: select Asset Pack.
- Cards may show pack-specific naming (Assumption) if defined.

## View Bundle Items
1. Open a bundle's product details.
2. Click View Items (if shown) to switch to bundle items page.
3. Each item is listed similar to normal assets.

## Purchase Behavior
- Buying a bundle grants ownership of all included assets (inferred from code updating multiple product IDs).

## See Also
- [Browse Assets](browse-assets.md)
- [Buy Products](buy-products.md)

## Assumptions
Bundle labeling inferred; adjust when UI finalized.
